# Predator

If you are a fan of the science-fiction film Predator, this screensaver is for you! It will transport you back to those nostalgicically memorable years and transform your Mac into a Predator clock. Don't worry, your Mac won't blow up ðŸ˜„

It is completely open source, feel free to contribute!

## Compatibility

Requires OS X El Capitan 10.12 or above

## Installation

1. [Click here to download the latest release](https://github.com/vpeschenkov/Predator/releases/download/1.0.6/Predator.saver.zip)
2. Open **Predator.saver** (double click)
3. `"Predator.saver" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer` will appear, press `OK`
4. Open `Preferences`
5. Select `Security & Privacy`
6. Select `General`
7. On the bottom side, select `Open Anyway`

If you see an error message saying "This app is damaged and can't be opened, you should move it to the trash", download the file with Safari, to prevent macOS Gatekeeper from throwing that error. Note that some outdated unzip software may cause that issue too.

**Important**: If you haven't quit System Preferences before installation and were upgrading from a previous version, I strongly recommend you quit the application after installation, then reopen it, as updated Swift screensavers aren't loaded correctly in an active System Preferences session.

## Features

- Customize the color of the clock to your preference
- Select between 12-hour and 24-hour clock formats
- Remove unnecessary lines to achieve the look of the clock in the movie
- Additional features and customization options are also available ðŸ™‚
